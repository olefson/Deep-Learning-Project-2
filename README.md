# Deep-Learning-Project-2
This repository contains the code and documentation for Project 2: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which is part of my Deep Learning coursework. The project involves designing and training recurrent neural networks using GRU and LSTM architectures to predict sequences based on provided data.
